# If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere

Here I will try to tease what are my future life ambitions, related to my self-improvement and also career pretensions, maybe this will fit for someone, just sharing my thoughts...

What are the things you have done that you feel most fulfill your soul?
For me the answer is easy, stimulate my mind with different, "chatty" and intelligent people. My ideas and ambitions start to "bubble" when I'm close with these hidden gems, simple like that. No matter how determined you are, it's hard not to be influenced by the people around you. Surround by poor and lazy minds, maybe you will acquire the same behavior, in the end, it's your duty to perceive that!

## Big cities

Big cities call the attention of brave gems. It's hard to settle, to find your "place" and principally adapt to the new environment, all things will push you down in the beginning, it's your work to find new connections, friends, a job, and also build a welfare environment.

This made me question myself, what are the places with outstanding brains in my area?

- If you are a content creator, maybe Los Angeles?
- Engineer, Germany?
- Doctor, Canada?
- Lawyer, Washington?

- **Software engineer: Palo Alto and Berlin**

You don't hear people claiming on the internet that they want to move to Brazil to study computing, the country is really beautiful in other aspects, but to be a brilliant mind in this field, probably not!

In the end, big cities, at least for me, tell a hidden message: You could do more!

## Stability X Ambition

People who are looking for **stability** are not brave enough to chase their dreams. Hard to hear that, no? But it's true, [that's life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnlPtaPxXfc). Putting your mind in the life game it's tough, it's challenging and surrounded by uncertainties. For this reason, I have this opinion that these words are antonyms, it is impossible to dream high if you are chasing stability and the same for the opposite, find ambition in a "marasmus" environment.


## The squeaky wheel gets the grease

Working from home it's really awesome, but it's also a safe environment, you don't need to take care of a lot of fears that, in the end, will push you forward. Frustration triggers reasoning, and reasoning triggers actions, which in turn, trigger different decisions in life.

It's also hard to hear that, but probably, you and I don't have any special knack, we are just normal people trying to be someone, and the only way to "pierce your bubble" if you don't have an influential family or is a rich guy, it's putting effort on the right things. And for me, this is really related to the beginning of this essay: **stimulate your mind with the different.**

This could be achieved, for example, by making new friends, moving to another city, or starting to read a new book, but the fact is, the place where indecision lives is the same place that will make you reap more achievements, and maybe this will trigger the loop that I'm talking about!

## The best

I think that just the phrase:


> If you aren't trying to be the best, how you will be good?

Compile all. Not too much to mention

## Conclusion

In the end, to summarize everything, I will come back to the essay title: "If you can make it there, you can make it anywhere".

If you are able to change your environment, be close to different cultures, and still stand out, you can do that in any place of the world, we are human and were genetically built to do that. For this reason, at least now, I'm focused on figuring out the maximum of new experiences, that's what makes more sense for me.
