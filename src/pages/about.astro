		Hey, I'm Jonathan, 24, from Brazil, and I started learning and working in IT when I was 14 years old. During university, I was involved in projects and study groups related to shared knowledge in open talks, about distributed systems, AI, Big Data, and even some crazy startup ideas. I've already graduated, and since 2019, I've been working in startup environments, dedicating myself to enhancing my engineering career.
